and access their timeline.

- A user should be able to send and accept friend requests from others which will allow
them to be friends with others and enable them to interact with them.
- A user should be able to like, comment, and share the status/timeline posts of their
friends.

## Features:
- Able to log in and register.
- Able to accept and reject friend requests.
